/**
 * A data model (as in MVC) that keeps the data in JSON format
 *
 * This model is thread safe and internally synchronized. You can synchronize
 * off this object to safely access multiple fields at once without interference
 * from model updates which may come in from other background threads.
 *
 * The point of JSONModel is, like XMLModel, to allow you to create a local Object of type
 * JSONModel which may last the entire life of your application. You can then
 * refer to values from JSONModel and know that it always contains the latest,
 * best JSONObject received from the server or loaded from the local cache.
 * 
 * You can update the value in JSONModel by passing it as an object when you
 * call JSONGetter(url, myJSONMOdel). If you would like to execute some code such
 * as updating the user interface after the JSONModel is updated asynchonously,
 * you should chain() that continuation code (a Task or UITask) to the JSONGetter.
