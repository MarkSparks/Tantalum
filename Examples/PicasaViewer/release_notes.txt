Picasa Viewer 1.0
=================

PicasaViewer is a cross platform app that shows the top featured images on the
Picasa web gallery and allows the user to search for specific images on the
service. The application has been implemented so that the S40 and Android
versions share common engine code. The user interface implementations are
different (LCDUI in Series 40 and Android UI library in Android). The project
utilises Tantalum4 cross platform development library in the implementation of
the common functionality.

This example application demonstrates adaptive design, performance, JSON
parsing, advanced caching and cross-platform techniques on Java applications.

This example application is hosted in Nokia Developer Projects:
- http://projects.developer.nokia.com/picasa_viewer

1. Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application displays a grid of images downloaded from Picasa. The user can 
tap an image to display it in full screen. The full screen view also shows
the image title and the author of the image. The full screen view can be
dismissed by tapping the screen or by selecting Back.

By default the application displays Picasa featured images. In Category Bar
(S40) or Menu (Android) there's option to search images. When user types the
search terms the displayed images are refreshed on fly. An efficient cache is
utilised to restore the previously downloaded images.
