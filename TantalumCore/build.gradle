 * TantalumCore/build.gradle
 *
 * Builds the TantalumCore-project, and generates two jar files
 *
 * Tantalum.jar contains preprocessed classes without logging and other debug code
 *
 *  TantalumCore-debug.jar contains the compiled code from the original sources
 *
 * The project contains an additional config, called 'codeCoverageJar', which
 * packages and exposes the cobertura-instrumented classes as a jar file.
 * This jar file is being used by the J2SE-project to execute the unit tests
 * and generate the coverage report.
